# Club Members
A database cleaning project 

## Introduction 
Use a database with made-up data on people joining a club. This will include their name, address, occupation, etc.
The source file was made intentionally messy so there will be lots of cleaning to do.

### Tasks
* Go through each column to check for any missing data or outliers, odd formatting or wrongly inputted data.
* Remove every non-alphabetical character where they do not need to be
* Trim all leading and/or trailing spaces
* Separate names by first and last name, and addresses by street, city, and state. Concatenate the names if need be (multiple part names e.g. De la Cruz)
* Remove extra digits from any age with them.
* Replace missing values with nulls
* Use emails (unique entry) to find duplicate rows

## Takeaways 
I really enjoyed this project. It was a real mind game for me to figure out the index numbers to use to concatenate data like last names. 
When the run was successful, I would jump for joy.
